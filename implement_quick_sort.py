Just unlikely merge Sort, QuickSort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

    Always pick the first element as a pivot
    Always pick the last element as a pivot
    Pick a random element as a pivot
    Pick median as a pivot

Here we will be picking the last element as a pivot. The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element â€˜xâ€™ of array as a pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.

// low  --> Starting index,
// high  --> Ending index
quickSort(arr[], low, high) {

  // Till starting index is lesser than ending index
  if (low < high) {

    // pi is partitioning index,
    // arr[p] is now at right place
    pi = partition(arr, low, high);

    // Before pi
    quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
    // After pi
    quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
  }
